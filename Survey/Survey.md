In the survey, we categorize Android push notifications from two divisions:

(1)Pushing behavior, based on the way how notifications are pushed/displayed to
mobile users.

(2)Notification content, based on the actual contents distributed in
notifications (both the contents displayed and the redirected contents after
clicking).

The classification is not completely orthogonal, while it covers most common
cases of push notifications. The actual push notification will belong to at
least one type of behavior pushes and at least one type of content pushes. In
this survey, we divide 23 types of push notifications, based on their content,
into 5 groups. And in each group, we further subdivide each group based on the
bahavior. Each type will be provided with an example screenshot and their
explanation.
